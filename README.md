# JS Sketches
  
Small JavaScript sketches, animations, drawings, and mini-projects. You can think of it as a personal sandbox for the purposes of experimentation, learning, and fun.

## Current Sketches
More will be added over time.

#### Sketch Template
A simple empty sketch, used as a template. *Note: Please use the colour __"#23272a"__ if you can for the background of all sketches as to maintain a uniform look on the webhub.*

#### Fractal Tree
A fractal tree, recursion based. A good start on understanding recursion and DOM elements.
