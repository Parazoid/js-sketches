# JS Sketches
  
Small JavaScript sketches, animations, drawings, and mini-projects. You can think of it as a personal sandbox for the purposes of experimentation, learning, and fun.

## Current Sketches
More will be added over time.

### Sketch Template
A simple empty sketch, used as a template. *Note: Please use the colour __"#23272a"__ if you can for the background of all sketches as to maintain a uniform look on the webhub.*

### Fractal Tree
A fractal tree, recursion based. A good start on understanding recursion and DOM elements.

### 10PRINT
A JavaScript re-implementation of the Commodore 64 BASIC one-line program;

```10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10```

A click anywhere on the page will restart the sketch.  There's a book titled [10PRINT](https://10print.org/) that explains the beauty of the program in way more detail. Re-implementing it in JavaScript doesn't really do it justice.

*Fun Fact: The C64 character set is called PETSCII, from the prior Commodore Pet. It’s interesting because unlike ASCII, it’s full of graphics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETSCII*
